question 1 = index.js 
my function swap takes thestring as the input
the  split('') is for changing the string to array of characters
for iteration i use map for which if the character is lowercase it is then changed to upper case
then i join the modified characters to string and returns the result
question 2 = next.js =  generate  array between numbers
boy takes (start,end) as input
due to the stand and end and declaring a variable direction i am able to determine whether direction is positive or negative
array.from enables me tocreate an array  of the desired length
the start  + (i *  direction) which i got from google enales me to calculate the value of each element  based on the starting value,index and direction 
question 3 = messi.js = finding prime number
